### DevOps pipeline to deploy java application

**1. Code development and testing**

Developers write the Java code and unit tests for the application. They run the tests locally to ensure the code is working as expected.

**2. Version control and code management** 

Developers commit their changes to a Git repository, which serves as the central code repository for the project. The repository is managed with tools like GitLab, Bitbucket, or GitHub.

**3. Code analysis**

Code is scanned for issues like code complexity, security vulnerabilities, and style violations. Tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle, or PMD can be used for code analysis.

**4. Continuous integration** 

A continuous integration (CI) system such as Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD is used to automatically build, test, and package the application each time code changes are committed to the repository.

**5. Artifact management**

The build artifacts are stored in a repository like Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, or AWS S3 for later use.

**6. Automated testing** 
   
The application is deployed to a staging environment and automated tests are run to ensure it works as expected.

**7. Security scanning**

The application is scanned for security vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or Qualys.

**8. Continuous delivery**

Once the code passes all the tests and security scans, the CI system automatically deploys it to a staging environment for additional testing. If the code passes all the tests in the staging environment, it can be automatically deployed to production.

**9. Deployment and monitoring**

The final stage is to deploy the code to the production environment and monitor it to ensure it is working as expected. Tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus can be used for monitoring.
